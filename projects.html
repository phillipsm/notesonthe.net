			<h2>Working in Widener</h2>
						<div class="left insert"><img width="500" height="330" src="images/wiw-placeholder.png"></div>
			<p>Working in Widener is a fun, educational game. You are assigned five books. You try to shelve them as fast as possible. You can play by yourself or with a buddy. If you're playing in single player mode, you are racing against the clock. If you're playing in two-player mode, you are trying to shelve your books before your opponent shelves their books.</p>
			<p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/working-in-widener">Play Working in Widener in your browser now.</a></p>
			<p>As you play the game you get a feel for <a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/widener/">Harvard's Widener Library</a>. We sliced four floors out of Widener and reduced the number of shelves on each level. The floor plan is close to what you'll find in the physical world, the call number locations too. Oh, and you're shelving real books with real call numbers from the Harvard Catalog.</p>
			<p>Why is Working in Widener good? As you play the game, you gain some insight into the physical layout of Widener Library and how to how the items (books in most cases) are arranged. You learn that similar books share similar classifications and you become a little more familiar with the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/classification/">Library of Congress Classification scheme.</a></p>
			<p>We built Working in Widener in JavaScript using node.js and Socket.IO. node.js allows for a many two player games to happen at once and Socket.IO makes it easy to push player positions and updates to each player.</p>
			<p>The game was fun to build, play, and watch others play. Being fun and being playful is not at odds with work. Quite the opposite in fact. Hours of toil should be filled with fun investigations and a playful, open approach.</p>
			<p>My labmate, Annie Cain, and I built Working in Widener together in the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu">Harvard Library Innovation Lab.</a></p>
						<h2>Awesome Box</h2>
			<div class="right insert"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JpP7g9TXJ4Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
			<p>The Awesome Box is an alternate returns box at your library. If you checked out an item and you thought it was awesome, for whatever reason, you return it to the Awesome Box instead of the regular returns box. From the Awesome Box it gets tagged as Awesome and then proceeds through the normal library return process.</p>
			<p>Items that are tagged as Awesome are shared through an Awesome Box website and through Twitter. Sharing isn't limited to the Web though, libraries can feature Awesome items on a shelf or place stickers on the spines of the items when they're shelved.</p>
			<p>Why is the Awesome Box good? Lots of reasons. My favorite is its simplicity. You can vote for library items that you thought were mind-blowing without having to register a new user name and password, or determine if one star is better than five stars, or any other malarkey -- the vote is part of your normal item return flow. Also, it is incredibly inclusive: kids and other Web-distant members of the community don't need to get online to share what they liked.</p>
			<p>We have placed Awesome Boxes in six of Harvard's 73 libraries. They seem to be working. Have a look at the <a href="http://www.librarylab.law.harvard.edu/awesome/">	Harvard Awesome Box site</a>. We're working to get Awesome Boxes into public libraries.</p>
			<p>My labmate, Annie Cain, and I are co-investigators on this project in the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu">Harvard Library Innovation Lab.</a></p>
